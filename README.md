I am developing a new 3rd-person 3D survival shooter multiplayer game and am looking for beta testers to help me fine-tune the experience. The game is set within a small, distinct portion of the fictional "SOE" map, which I've designed to be visually reminiscent of the original while offering a fresh layout.
My goal is to create a seamless, low-friction gameplay experience. Players will be able to jump directly into the action without the need for an account, a formal ranking system, or levels. This ensures that the focus remains on the pure joy of the game and the thrill of survival.
I will upload the game files for download once I have added a variety of weapons to the in-game arsenal. I look forward to your valuable feedback as I work to make this a truly engaging and unrestricted shooter game.
